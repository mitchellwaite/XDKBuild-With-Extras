# XDKBuild-With-Extras

## Note!

I've been working on a few different patch sets, and was duplicating work across repositories. I've thus moved everything over to the following location.

https://github.com/mitchellwaite/xbox360_xebuild_patches

I've also added 64mb DevGL support and fixed the issues i was having with RGLoader.

## Rest of the intro

XDKBuild but with more patches. (Eventually)

RGLoader is nice, but it's quite a bit more complex to set up. It's also nice to be able to boot the system without a hard drive installed on a 16mb system... xshell is "good enough" for a lot of things. I'd like to have a "set it and forget it" NAND image that just has "the" patch set and that's that.
